# Analysis of Arabic Tweets and Al-Ghazali's Literary Compositions

This project contains code for conducting two experiments on different datasets: analyzing Arabic tweets and analyzing the literary compositions of Abu Hamid Al Ghazali. The code is designed to be run in Google Colab, and requires users to upload their own datasets to the Colab environment in order to run the code.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to have access to Google Colab. Once you have Colab set up, you can open the notebook file (`'BiLSTM_Arabic_Tweets_XXX'.ipynb`) and follow the instructions to upload your dataset and run the code.

### Prerequisites

To run this code, you will need:

- A Google account
- Access to Google Colab
- A dataset of Arabic tweets for the first experiment
- A dataset of Arabic tweets for the second experiment
- A dataset of Al-Ghazali's literary compositions for the third experiment

### Installing

There is no installation required for this project, as it is designed to be run in Google Colab.

## Running the Code

To run the code for this project, follow these steps:

1. Open the 'BiLSTM_Arabic_Tweets_XXX..ipynb' file in Google Colab.
2. Upload your dataset of Arabic tweets or Al-Ghazali's literary compositions to the Colab environment.
3. Run the code cells in the notebook file, following the instructions provided.
